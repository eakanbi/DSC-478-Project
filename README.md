In this analysis, we sought to discern the major factors that play into Uberâ€™s pricing model and how these factors influence the determination of fare price and fare rate. Using a dataset of 200,000 Uber trips from the New York City Metropolitan area between 2008 and 2015, we used a combination of clustering and classification machine learning techniques to reveal which circumstances result in higher fares. Discretized classes of fare price and fare rate were labeled using various binning and clustering methods before being modeled using Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Linear Discriminant Analyses.
